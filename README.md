+ Hello From Montpellier, south of France :)
+ Here's my humble participation to the Outline 2022 with :

  + "4k Freedom Force - An Old School Tribute"
    + Demo file is : "4k-Freedom-Force.html" or "index.html"
    + Size file is : 4081bytes 
    + [.oO° 4k Freedom Force Online Demo °Oo.](https://captainfurax.github.io/Freedom-Force-4k/)
    + If interested, a readable source file is available : 03_4k-Freedom-Force_Readable_Src.html
  + Performance holds in : 
      + No Use of Canvas
      + No Use of external Library
      + Demo holds in one single file [ CSS, Gfxs, HTML, JS Code ]
  + Particularity :
    + A Small/tiny Humble kind of '3D Engine' for the 4 'dotball' objects is 'embedded' with few procedural functions :)
    + Checkerboard is 100% made and animated in Full CSS : No additionnal Gfxs or stuff for it !
    + Like at "good old time", text is based on an ASCII-Ordered and embedded bitmap 16x16 font...Where i move a X-Offset inside to Draw characters 
      on the fly with a simple 'img' tag ! [ Thx to an HTML-Hack i discovered few months ago with Scrolltexts experiments ! ]
    + Unfortunatly : no sound, or only the 'desert sound' - I had no more place [ 4Kb was my frontier ] to add a kind of HTML-audio-generated-soundchip...
