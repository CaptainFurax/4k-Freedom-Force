+ Hello From Montpellier, south of France :)
+ Here's my humble participation to the Outline 2022 with :

  + "4k Freedom Force - An Old School Tribute"
    + Demo file is : "4k-Freedom-Force.html" or "index.html"
    + Size file is : 4081bytes 
    + [.oOÂ° 4k Freedom Force Online Demo Â°Oo.](https://captainfurax.github.io/4k-Freedom-Force/)
    + If interested, a readable source file is available : 03_4k-Freedom-Force_Readable_Src.html
  + Performance holds in : 
    + __No Use of Canvas__
    + __No Use of External Library__ [ such as p5.js, phaser.io, zim, pixi.js, etc... ]
    + Demo holds in __one single file__ [ CSS, Gfxs, HTML, JS Code ]
    + Checkerboard is __100% made and animated in Full CSS__ : No additionnal Gfxs or stuff for it !
  + Particularity :
    + A *Small/tiny-Humble* kind of '3D Engine' for the 4 'dotball' objects is 'embedded' with few procedural functions :)
    + Like at "good old time Scrolltexts", text is drawn on the fly with an ASCII-Ordered and embedded bitmap 16x16 font...Where i move a X-Offset inside to Draw characters 
      on the fly with a simple 'img' tag ! [ Thx to an HTML-Hack i discovered few months ago with Scrolltexts experiments ! ]
    + Unfortunatly : no sound, or only the 'desert sound' - I had no more place [ 4Kb was my frontier ] to add a kind of HTML-audio-generated-soundchip... ðŸ‘Ž
  + Story :
    + I started experiments to reproduce Old School Demo Fx in 'pure' HTML/CSS/JS such as rasters, scrolltexts, checkerboard, etc...during first Covid
      lockdown.
    + The only thing i didn't succeed to reproduce at this time, in 'pure' HTML/CSS/JS is a Plasma Fx...
    + I planned to present this screen for the Revision 2022...But due to a strong covid in 23th of march, i gave up...
    + And Long-Long time ago, in a far-far-far away galaxy : i started coding and experiments in GFA-Basic and ASM on an Atari ST :) ðŸ¦–
  + Parental Advisory :-) : 
    + This is *"Dirty" HTML*, no headers, no closing "</body>" tag, etc...So, it's __100% not at all W3C validated__ - It is size-optimized...
    + ...and not responsive too => Don't even try to __resize your window during playing, it'll screw the demo correct playing !!!__
    + Proudly tested on an I5-4590/8Gb RAM + 512Mb Graphic Card
    + __Best rendering on : Linux/Chrome, Linux/Chromium, W8.1/Chrome, W8.1/Chromium.__
    + Weird rendering on : Linux/Firefox [ weird & slow ], W8.1/Edge[ weird behaviour ], W8.1/Firefox [ a bit Weird ]
    + __Won't work at all on Apple/Safari -> Worst, it can freeze your browser.__
    + Tested on LED 1920x1080 & LCD 1680x1050

With no doubt : i dedicate this screen to __PEOPLE OF UKRAINE FIGHTING 4 THEIR FREEDOM.__


Thx 4 reading me,
